This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where the JSON request body is not parsed correctly. The bug occurs because the `express.json()` middleware is not properly used.  The solution involves correctly placing the `express.json()` middleware before the route handler that expects a JSON body.  This ensures that the request body is parsed into a usable format before the route handler attempts to access it.
